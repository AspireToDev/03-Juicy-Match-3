# Project Name
Project 3 for Indiana University's Game Technology Course

Developed from 2/20/2022 to 3/2/2022

This is the Juicy Match-3 project where the goal was to take a regular bare-bones Match-3 game (akin to Bejeweled or Candy Crush) and turn it into something "Juicy" and unique. This is not a systems based project but rather an art and sound based project. 

My theme for my Match-3 game is natural elements. Drawing from themes like Avatar: The Last Airbender or World of Warcraft's Shaman class.

## Implementation
1 Background Song that loops
Animated title screen
3 backgrounds 
3 different levels that ramp in difficulty
5 individual sprites that were hand drawn in Piskel
5 sound effects for the death of each piece
4 Additional sprites per piece to represent the Row,Column, Adjacent, and Color bombs. (20 Additional sprites)

## Future Development

Hopeful to add shaders that act on line and adjacent explosions. Individualizing each type of explosion to each specific element.

Scoring system using "Element Tokens" which would be similar to the coin animation that spawns the coins on the dying piece and then tweens into the top left corner. Still need to create this asset and implement this system when I have the time.
